        I have learnt about the introduction of HTML. HTML stands for <b>H</b>yper <b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage. It helps in displaying content of page into
        structured manner. At first i understood the meaning if all the basics tags . As for starter we can look to very first tag
        <strong>!DOCTYPE html</strong> tag tell us the version of html we are using.After that, <strong>head</strong> tag tell us about all the important info 
        about the page which are not displayed on  screen while rendering. The <em>head</em> tag includes some tages like<strong>meta charset</strong> which tell 
        the character set we are using ,say <quote>UTF-8</quote> . Other important tag <i>nested </i> in <em>head</em> is <strong>title </strong> which displays the title of 
        page in the browser title bar. Up next we have <strong>body</strong> tag which contains all the content of page to be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Up i learned about some tags. They are:-
        <ol type="A">
            <li>&lt;p&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;strong&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;b&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;em&gt;</li>
            <li>&lt;i&gt;</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of the features that i learnt are:-
        <ul type="square">
            <li>Linking</li>
            <li><a href="imagep.html" target="_blank">Image placement</a></li>
            <li><a href="list.html" target="_self">List</a></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
